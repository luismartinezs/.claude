description: Remember key insights in context/memory with a sensible filename. No timestamps.
---

Your goal is to create a "memory" of the current context for easy and quick future reference.
Create a new Markdown file in `context/memory/` folder and write a "memory" of our current conversation for future reference.
Use a short, human-readable slug as filename based on the conversation theme.
Identify the Core Topic: What was the main goal or problem we worked on?
Extract Key Learnings: What were the most important discoveries, decisions, or solutions?
Summarize Concisely: Write a brief summary in Markdown. Use a main heading for the topic and bullet points for the key learnings.
At the top of the new file, in a frontmatter, add relevant tags to quickly identify the topic:
```md
---
tags: [tag1, tag2, ...]
---
```
Add a new line to `context/memory/index.md` with the filename and a one sentence description of the content
Focus on compressing key knowledge effectively and tersely
Think hard
