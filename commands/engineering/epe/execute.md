$ARGUMENTS
Now think hard and carry out the plan.
Produce only the necessary work to meet the goal.
Do not add backwards compatibility unless explicitly requested.
After each step, verify it meets the success criteria or checks defined in the plan.
For code: lint, compile, and run tests.
For non-code: review artifacts or outputs against the plan.
