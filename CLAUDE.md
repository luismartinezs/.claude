- Explain what youâ€™ll do first and ask for my confirmation before coding
- Default to the simplest solution first
- Use modules rather than large files
- Only make the changes I request
- Avoid code duplication, look for existing solutions in the codebase
- put scratchpad files in ./context/scratchpads
- Prefer functional programming over class-based OOP
- For javascript / typescript, use functional programming and avoid class syntax as much as possible
- Use vertical architecture: features end to end in small complete slices
- Prefer path aliases for cross-slice imports
- Prefer relative imports for within-slice imports
- Never blindly say I'm right, never say I am "absolutely right"
- Always assume dev server is already running
