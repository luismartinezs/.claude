$ARGUMENTS

Within the context of TDD, list a minimal simplest set of tests consisting on input-output pairs, that ensure acceptance criteria above are fulfilled. Then scaffold the tests and run them to confirm they fail. Do not do any changes in the code besides writing tests.

Review existing tests in the codebase and avoid creating any duplicates

If after writing the tests, some of them already pass, look into other pre-existing test files and check whether overlapping tests already existed. If there are ovelapping tests, remove the duplicated new tests
