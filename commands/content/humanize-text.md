description: Make AI generated text more closely resemble human-written text
argument-hint: The text to rewrite
---

Rewrite the following text so it reads like a genuine message from a real person with lived experience. Remove the overly neat structure, generic phrasing, and excessive polish typical of AI. Use natural rhythm with varied sentence lengths, occasional informal touches, and specific, plausible details that a real person might mention. Keep the tone warm, direct, and authentic — as if you’re actually talking to the recipient. Avoid filler phrases, unnecessary summarizing, or textbook transitions. Preserve the original meaning and intent, but make it sound like something a thoughtful human would naturally write
