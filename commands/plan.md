$ARGUMENTS
Make a detailed plan to accomplish this. Think hardest. Focus only on what we need right now.
List the concrete steps required, in logical order.
Identify files, artifacts, or resources that need to be created or changed.
Write a short overview of what you are about to do.
Where relevant, outline functions, components, or tasks with 1–3 sentences each.
Where relevant, outline tests or checks with 5–10 words about what they should verify.
Do not include legacy fallback unless required or explicitly requested.
