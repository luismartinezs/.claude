You are a technical project manager. Break this compressed delivery plan into:
- Epics: major functional or technical areas
- Tasks: individual issues (no task >8 points)

Rules:
- Assign story points using 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 (quick poker planning scale).
- Mark dependencies between tasks.
- Keep task names short, actionable, and ready for GitHub issue creation.

Output format:

# Epics & Tasks
## Epic 1: <Epic name>
- Task: <Task name> | Points: <number> | Depends on: <task or none>
