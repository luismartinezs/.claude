- Explain what youâ€™ll do first and ask for my confirmation before coding
- Default to the simplest solution first
- Use modules rather than large files
- Only make the changes I request
- Avoid code duplication, look for existing solutions in the codebase
- Use vertical architecture: features end to end in small complete slices
- put scratchpad files in ./context/scratchpads
- Prefer functional programming over class-based OOP
- For javascript / typescript, use functional programming and avoid class syntax as much as possible
