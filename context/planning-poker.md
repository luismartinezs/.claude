# Fibonacci Poker – One-Pager

**Purpose**
Estimate development tasks by relative effort, not exact time. Build team alignment, surface hidden complexity, and avoid false precision.

**Fibonacci sequence used**
0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, (sometimes 34)
Numbers grow quickly to reflect rising uncertainty for larger tasks.

**How it works**
A task is described. Each developer selects a card (or number) in secret. All reveal at once. If estimates differ, discuss the reasoning. Repeat until the team converges on a number or accepts the median.

**Meaning of values**
0 = trivial or already done
1–3 = small task, clear scope
5–8 = medium, multiple steps or a full day+
13 = large, risky, needs discussion
21+ = too big, must be broken down

**Guidelines**

* Compare tasks to a known reference story (“this feels like a 3”).
* Do not equate points to hours. Story points reflect complexity, uncertainty, and effort.
* Focus on differences. Wide spread in votes signals hidden assumptions.
* Large numbers highlight where to split or clarify scope.

**Why Fibonacci**
Spacing increases as numbers grow, forcing coarse-grained estimates for bigger work. This keeps discussion practical and prevents false accuracy.
