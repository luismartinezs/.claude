description: Make a minimal implementation plan
---
$ARGUMENTS
Make a detailed plan to accomplish this. Think hardest. Focus only on what we need right now.
The plan must be as simple and minimal as possible, to just fulfill acceptance criteria.
List the concrete steps required, in logical order.
Identify files, artifacts, or resources that need to be created or changed.
Write an overview of what you are about to do.
Where relevant, outline functions, components, or tasks with 1–3 sentences each.
Where relevant, outline tests or checks with 5–10 words about what they should verify.
Do not include legacy fallback unless required or explicitly requested.
Once finished, write down the plan in a new md file in context/plans. For each major step of the plan add one unchecked md checkbox (`[ ]`)
